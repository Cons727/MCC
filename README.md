## MCC Assignments and Projects

Welcome to my MCC repository. Here you will find some of the work my team and I created to complete the Master's in Computer Science. The works presented here pertain to different subjects: Machine Learning, Computer Algorithms, Applied Mathematics, and Intelligent Systems. All of the projects are in Jupyter Notebook, and some contain the PDF manuscript.

## Contents

* In the *Advanced ML* directory, an assignment of Machine Learning was done leveraging VIC.
* *Dynamic Programming* contains a function to transform one string into another with the least number of steps, designed with a dynamic programming approach.
* In *Knight Move Game*, my professor designed a chessboard game. The objective was to elaborate the best heuristics to win the game.
* In the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the final project of the ML class was to find a way to predict COVID-19. My team and I decided to use MSD and clustering to find possible patients in risk.
* *PSAs and Heuristic Search* was an assignment of Intelligent Systems; the objective was to design a heuristic that best solved a puzzle.
* The *Treasure Hunter* project is similar to the one mentioned above, but a different puzzle.
* For the final project of Applied Mathematics, my team and I programmed and effectively applied a visual cryptography method.
